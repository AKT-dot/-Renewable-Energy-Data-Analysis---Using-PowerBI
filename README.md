🔋 Renewable Energy Data Analysis - Using PowerBI
This project uses PowerBI to analyze and visualize detailed information about various renewable energy systems. The dataset includes data on installed capacity, 
energy production, consumption, storage, investment, and environmental impact.



Overview
This dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview for useful research and analysis. It includes various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and analyses such as:

Investments and Incentives: Analyzes the investments made by different funding sources and the incentives achieved.
Total Jobs: Displays the impact of renewable energy on employment.
Storage Efficiency & ROI: Measures storage efficiency and energy return on investment.
Pollution Index: Evaluates the environmental impact of renewable energy systems.
Capacity Analysis: Compares the difference between minimum and average installed capacities.
Conditionally Formatted Data View: Provides a tabular view of data with conditional formatting to highlight key values.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the installation instructions and explore the various dashboards and analyses available.
